## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
For this assignment we were given code that prints hello world in the serial moniter

Here's how you make code look like code:

```from time import sleep

while True:
    print("Hello world!!!!!")
    sleep(5)
```

### Wiring
none

### Reflection
This assignment was very easy because there was no wiring and all it does is print hello world.



## CircuitPython_Servo
